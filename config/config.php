 * extensions can add functionality to the core system without having to
 * modify the source code.

 *   $GLOBALS['TL_HOOKS'] = array
 *   (
 *       'hook_1' => array
 *       (
 *           array('Class', 'Method'),
 *           array('Class', 'Method')
 *       )
 *   );
 * 
 * Use function array_insert() to modify an existing hooks array.
